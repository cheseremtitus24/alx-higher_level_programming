This project Features the different operations that can be performed using the following data structure:

1. Dictionaries
2. Lists
3. Sets
a = {2,5,7,9}
b = {4,6,8,2}
a & b
# OUT: {2}
a ^ b
# OUT: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
a - b
# OUT: {9, 5, 7}
a | b
# OUT: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
a.union(b)
# OUT: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
a.intersection(b)
# OUT: {2}
a.difference(b)
# OUT: {9, 5, 7}
a.symmetric_difference(b)
# OUT: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

4. tuples
