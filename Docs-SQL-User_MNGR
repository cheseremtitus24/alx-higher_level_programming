# Mysql User Management
# List Active user accounts;
mysql >  select user,host from mysql.user;
# creating a DB User 
mysql>CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
# Deleting a DB User
DROP USER 'sammy'@'localhost';

# Reviewing User's Permissions
You can review a userâ€™s current permissions by running the SHOW GRANTS command:
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'host';

# Granting user permissions on Databases and Tables. *.*,database.table

# N/B  WITH GRANT OPTION. This will allow your MySQL user to grant any permissions that it has to other users on the system.

mysql>GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

# Revoking Granted Permissions.
mysql> REVOKE type_of_permission ON database_name.table_name FROM 'username'@'host';

#Grant all permissions to user 
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'cheserem'@'%' with grant option;

### Granting Fine Grained Privileges on columns
Column privileges apply to single columns in a table.  You must specify the column or columns for each privilege, for example:

GRANT 
   SELECT (employeeNumner,lastName, firstName,email), 
   UPDATE(lastName) 
ON bidco.employees 
TO bob@localhost;

Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
In this example, bob@localhost can select data from four columns employeeNumber, lastName, firstName, and email and update only the lastName column in the employees table from within the bidco database.

## Granting Proxy Privileges to a User
Proxy user privileges allow one user to be a proxy for another. The proxy user gets all privileges of the proxied user. For example:

GRANT PROXY 
ON root 
TO alice@localhost;
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
In this example, alice@localhost assumes all privileges of root.

Finally, specify the account name of the user that you want to grant privileges after the TO keyword.

Notice that in order to use the GRANT statement, you must have the GRANT OPTION privilege and the privileges that you are granting. If the read_only system variable is enabled, you need to have the SUPER privilege to execute the GRANT statement.
